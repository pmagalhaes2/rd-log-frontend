##  üìñ API Endpoints

### Authentication

The backend API handles company, admin operations and is implemented with Java + Spring. The order data is handled by a mock API using JSON Server. The backend API's repository can be found [here](https://github.com/pmagalhaes2/rd-log-api).


### Logistic Companies

-   `GET /logistic-companies`: Retrieves a list of all logistic companies.
-   `GET /logistic-companies/{id}`: Retrieves a logistic company by ID.
-   `POST /logistic-companies`: Registers a new logistic company.
-   `POST /logistic-companies/login`: Login using the new logistic company registration.
-   `PUT /logistic-companies/{id}`: Updates a logistic company's information.
-   `DELETE /logistic-companies/{id}`: Deletes a logistic company.

### Orders (Mock API)

-   `GET /orders`: Retrieves a list of all orders.
-   `GET /orders/{id}`: Retrieves an order by ID.
-   `PUT /orders/{id}`: Updates an order's status (accept or decline).

To start the mock API server for orders:
```bash
$ npm run server
```

## üîß Environment Variables

To run the application, you will need to configure the following environment variables:

### Backend (Spring)

-   `DB_URL`: URL of the database connection.
-   `DB_USERNAME`: Database username.
-   `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password.

Example configuration in a `.env` file:

```bash
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/logistic
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

### Frontend (React)

-   `REACT_APP_API_URL`: URL of the backend API.
-   `REACT_APP_ORDER_API_URL`: URL of the mock order API.
-   `REACT_APP_CALCULATE_DISTANCE_KEY`: API Key of Distance Matrix API. 

Example `.env` file for frontend:


```bash 
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_ORDER_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
REACT_APP_CALCULATE_DISTANCE_KEY= 
```
